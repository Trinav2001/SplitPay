<h2>Hi, I am Trinav Rattan</h2>
<p><em>SplitPay is a personal project I built to simplify shared expenses with smart bill splitting, debt settlement, and expense tracking using Django, DRF, and web technologies.</em></p>

<br>

<b>The Challenge</b>
<br>
Build a web application that allows users to split bills and track shared expenses efficiently, similar to popular apps like Splitwise. The goal was to implement a fully functional prototype with smart debt resolution and an intuitive interface.

<br><br>

<b>What I Accomplished</b>
<br>
I successfully implemented key features for seamless bill management and expense tracking, including:
<ul>
  <li>User authentication with secure account creation and login</li>
  <li>Create and manage split groups for shared expenses</li>
  <li>Automatic calculation of who owes what with smart debt settlement</li>
  <li>RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework (DRF) for robust backend communication</li>
  <li>Responsive web design for usability across devices</li>
</ul>

<br>

<b>Technologies Used</b>
<ul>
  <li>Django</li>
  <li>Django REST Framework (DRF)</li>
  <li>SQLite</li>
  <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<br>

<b>Future Possible Functionalities</b>
<ul>
  <li>Add push notifications for payment reminders</li>
  <li>Integrate multiple currency support</li>
  <li>Enhance UI/UX with modern components and animations</li>
</ul>
